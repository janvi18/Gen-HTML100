                The batting statistics of test match cricket clearly say that Kohli is far ahead of Dhoni. Kohli has
                scored 27 test centuries while Dhoni has managed to score just 6 centuries. Kohli also averages more
                than 50 in test cricket which is a very remarkable figure
